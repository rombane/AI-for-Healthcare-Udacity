    "### **Code Description** \n",
    "The main processing code to extract the pulse rate value is ` RunPulseRateAlgorithm() ` which is integrated with two secondary processing functions : `BPF()` and `peakdetection()` to execute bandpass filtering and hearbeat signal peak detection, respectively. The default sampling rate is 125 Hz. In-depth details regarding the algorithm are presented with the code as code comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, simply run the `Evaluate()` function to execute the whole PPG-Accelerometer processing to extract the pulse rate(s) and subsequently, its error and scoring (aggregate mean error).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Description** \n",
    "The data that is utilized for algorithm development and code validation in this part of the project is Troika dataset. The data consist of Photopletysmograph (PPG) signal reading and 3-axis accelerometer signal reading. The accelerometers and PPG reading are produced simultaneously from record from 12 subjects with age ranging from 18 to 35 years old. Each subject produces 5 minutes of record, while performing different running speeds including rests. The reference heart rate is produced from ECG signal, which is not part of our input. Improvements on the data can be done by adding wider range of subject, longer recording duration, and/or installation of extra PPG sensors.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Algorithm Description** \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm receives input of PPG signal reading and 3-axis accelerometer signal reading (X-axis, Y-Axis, and Z-Axis). It returns pulse rate array and confidence array.  The algorithm works by bandpass-filtering the signals (PPG and Accelerometer components) as its first step. Then, each signal is divided into parts by a same length, which is based on the window length. The window length is chosen carefully so that it would sample the overall signal ideally so that the sample signal is long enough for pulse rate detection and short enough to produce actual and updated result. All signals are converted into fourier domain via 1D Fourier Transform. The three accelerometers signals are accumulated because we will focus on the frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some works are to be done (See code comments for more details) to see which PPG signal frequencies that is strong enough in magnitude and different enough from accelerometer frequency. This distinguishment is performed because higher accelerometer frequencies indicate subject constant movements (walking, running), while certain range PPG frequencies indicate the heartbeat frequencies(40-240 BPM). The strongest and unique PPG frequency will be assigned as a pulse rate. However, certain stabilizing algorithm needs to be performed to avoid fluctuative pulse rate reading. After a pulse rate value is chosen, it is put into a series of pulse rate reading which is in a form of array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulted pulse rate array is then compared with the ground truth pulse rate array. The difference between these two arrays, formulated as an error array, will be the first output of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence is quantified as the proportion between highlighted PPG frequency (which is having slightest difference with the chosen pulse rate frequency magnitude), compared against total magnitude of frequencies detected. This shows how strong a highlighted frequency, which is used as a pulse rate reference, against other (noise) frequencies. The confidence is accumulated for each window on signal sampling, as an array and will be the second output of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm may not work properly if : \n",
    "> - Unsuitable window length is used (too long or too short).\n",
    "> - Due to the stabilizer algorithm , sudden drastic change on pulse rate may produce inaccurate result.\n",
    "> - Physical activity movements that mimick the subject's heart rate frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Algorithm Performance** \n",
    "\n",
    "An absolute mean value based metrics between estimated pulse rate against ground truth pulse rate is utilized to evaluate the algorithm performance, which showed acceptable result. The algorithm should be good for usage with other datasets, as long as the number of features and sensor installations are the same with the development/training dataset counterparts."
